z80dis.py is a Z80 disassembler.

It produces the assembler code for z88dk's z80asm.
Usage:

z80dis.py [-b binary] [-c] [-i inputfilename] [-o outputfilename] [-s start]

Parameters for -b are ranges of addresses separated by commas. For example:
-b 25000-30000,35000-36789
These ranges will be disassembled as (for example):
	defb 10
	defb 23
	defb 34
etc.
-c - show addresses of instructions as comments. For example:
	ld a, 52          ; 34567
	inc a             ; 34569

-i inputfilename - filename with binary code to disassemble. If -i is ommitted, data is read from stdin
-o outputfilename - filename for output. If -o is ommitted, output is written to stdout
-s start - start address (org). Default is 32768

The code is in the alpha stage.
